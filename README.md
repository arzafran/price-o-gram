# React Price-O-Gram generator!

This is just a basic React app to know the price-per-gram of stuff.

# Why would you do this?
Just to show how easy it's to create a React app. 

_And.. just to add some background:_
Talking with a colleague at work ([@matiasbeckerle](https://github.com/matiasbeckerle)) about the price of two kinds of cookies we got to the conclusion that the ones I eat usually are not that much pricey than the ones he consumes, but packing sizes tricked us to believe otherwise. 
So, as a joke, we discussed about creating a React app to do that simple math. And that's the waaaaaay the news goes!

Thanks for watching :)
